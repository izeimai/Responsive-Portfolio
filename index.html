        <p>I don't really know what to write here so I'm just going to blither and blather until it
            looks somewhat like a paragraph of text. I saw a mouse running along the edge of the room
            and I'm wondering what it was eating in this building. I have nuts in my bag. Nuts and M&Ms.
            I don't usually eat M&Ms but I got a funsize bag from a Halloween party and it was my cheat
            weekend so I mixed it into my nut bag. It's like a trail mix now. I'm excited about snack time.
        </p>
        <p>This is the second paragraph, I don't really know what to write in this either. But it looks like
            there are two paragraphs here. This is the second paragraph. I need to keep finding things to talk
            about. We formed a nice study group on Friday. It's good to have a dedicated space for ourselves.
            It was a bit of a bummer to learn that Penn doesn't allow access to the library for the Boot camp
            student. Maybe next time, I'll try to host at my place. That way I can just crawl into bed after
            the study sessions. Study group is so much more efficient.
